 /*  Checklist
 1. first turn angle
 2. tokyo1 distance
 3. tokyo2 distance
 4. to curve2 distance

 /* To be done:
 1. Calibrate Sharp value for ring and leaf.
 2. Check PS till first bud transfer as many times as we can for consistancy.
 3. DO NOT TRY TO INCREASE SPEED. MINIMUM CHANGES IN CODE.
 */
 
 /* next changes:
 1. Turret for leaf1 and 2 -> Main thing!! 
 2. turret is inconsistent
 3. first right turn is inconsis
 4. bud is falling down
 5. bud transfer distance when supekar is there

 /*BLUE ARENA CHANGES to be made - 2117 0503
Need to calibrate sharp for leaves
1. First turn 
   change transwheel
   if still no effect then affect distance and turn angle
2. Turret angle for leaf 1 and leaf 2
    CODE NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN
3. Encoder cup for manual bot
4. TSOP cup
5. To curve 2 overshoot after turn .
