  THOUGH THE DOCUMENTATION AND APPLICATION NOTES OF ALMOST ALL ICS/DEVICES/PROTOCOLS ARE AVAILABLE ; WE ARE MAKING DOCUMENTATION/APP NOTES AGAIN BECAUSE 

			IT ENHANCES YOUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE IC/DEVICE/PROTOCOL AND MAKES IT COMPLETE

			SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND - MAKE IT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE SO THAT OTHER TEAM MEMBERS DONT WASTE MUCH TIME.


title : name of ic - ic number

abstract:
give a 1 description of what this ic does. you can also give a simple example.

Pin diagram:
copy the image from the net - should have all the pins labelled

Pin connections :
explain each pin [ very simple terms ]
	in case of pins like vcc or vss mention which device or source provides this as well as the voltage level

*sample circuit:
make a block diagram of the the subsystem with all the connections to the ic or device.

	make provision for resistor/capacitor[with the value] or any other small component also.

*remarks:
in case of power components like transistor u can put the calculations for choosing resistors

u can mention the max current ratings

u can mention any warnings or some debugging issue that u might have faced.

		DOCUMENTATION FOR COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS 

TITLE: name of the protocol

ABSTRACT: 1 line description of the type of protocol. And in this specific case mention the devices/sensor used.

SEQUENCE OF COMM: mention master and slave devices. and the sequence of communication[which device sends data and when does the other device receive etc].

FRAME STRUCTURE: give the basic frame structure - total number os bits and their splitup.
				if the protocol requires deep understanding - mention start/stop/parity bits etc. and explain them else
										give details about only important bits/bytes.

VOLTAGE LEVELS: clearly mention input and output voltage levels,threshold levels, logic levels also.

*REAMRKS:
1. cable connections in case specific cables are required.
2. cable length 
3. any comments on the protocol and generally used area.

1. rs232
2. i2c
3. twi
4. can
5. usb




* - can be skipped if deemed unecessary
